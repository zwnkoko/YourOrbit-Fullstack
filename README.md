# 🪐 YourOrbit

**YourOrbit** is a modular personal productivity suite — part dashboard, part operating system — built for daily use. It hosts a growing collection of self-contained sub-apps (job tracker, shopping list, timezone converter, and more), all accessible via customizable widgets on a central home dashboard.

> 🚧 **This project is actively under development.** Expect frequent updates, changes, and new features as it evolves into a fully modular, personal productivity platform.

## ✨ Features (In Progress)

- 🧩 **Modular Widget System** – Drag-and-drop layout, customizable by user
- 🏠 **Home Dashboard** – Summarized widgets with quick glance data
- 📂 **Expandable Sub-Apps** – Each widget leads to a full-featured tool
- ⚡ **Real-Time Sync** – Shared state for collaborative tools (e.g., shopping list)
- 🎯 **Personalized Layouts** – Save and restore custom setups
- 🔌 **Plug-and-Play Architecture** – Add new modules without rewriting the core

## 🧠 Motivation

I built **YourOrbit** to solve my own daily productivity annoyances — timezone mismatches when watching football, scattered job application notes, forgotten grocery items — and to combine them into one unified, modular, and extensible system.

Instead of building many tiny single-purpose web apps, **YourOrbit** serves as a central place to manage it all.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js with TypeScript for REST APIs and real-time sync
- **State Management:** Zustand (frontend)
- **Realtime Sync:** WebSocket or Firebase integration planned
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API or local LLM for smart notes (planned)
